Define a function `product` that produces the product of a list of numbers.

Solution:
```
product []     = 1
product (x:xs) = x * product xs
```

Test: `product [2, 3, 4] = 24`
```
product [2, 3, 4] = 2 * product [3, 4]
                  = 2 * (3 * product [4])
                  = 2 * (3 * (4 * product []))
                  = 2 * (3 * (4 * 1))
                  = 2 * (3 * 4)
                  = 2 * 12
                  = 24
```
