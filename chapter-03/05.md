Two functions are equal if,
- they have the same type, and
- they return the same output value given the same input value, for all
  possible input values.

It's easy for the compiler to check whether the types of two functions are
equal. However, it is not feasible to check the second condition; the compiler
would have to go through *every single possible input* and verify that the
corresponding outputs from the functions are equal. This would take an enormous
amount of time.
